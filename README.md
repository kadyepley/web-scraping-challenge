# **Module 12 Challenge**
# Deliverable 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
### Import Splinter and BeautifulSoup
from splinter import Browser
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
browser = Browser('chrome')

## Step 1: Visit the Website
1. Use automated browsing to visit the [Mars news site](https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html). Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
   
### Visit the Mars news site
url = 'https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html'
browser.visit(url)

## Step 2: Scrape the Website
Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.

### Create a Beautiful Soup object
html = browser.html
soup = BeautifulSoup(html,"html.parser")

### Extract all the text elements
text_ele = soup.find_all("div", class_='list_text')
print(text_ele)

## Step 3: Store the Results
Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
* Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary. And, give each dictionary two keys: `title` and `preview`. An example is the following:
  ```python
  {'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
   'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."
  }
  ```
* Store all the dictionaries in a Python list.
* Print the list in your notebook.
  
### Create an empty list to store the dictionaries
list = []

### Loop through the text elements
### Extract the title and preview text from the elements
### Store each title and preview pair in a dictionary
### Add the dictionary to the list
for element in text_ele:
    title = element.find('div', class_='content_title').text
    preview = element.find('div', class_='article_teaser_body').text
    result = {'title': title, 'preview': preview}
    list.append(result)
print(list)
    
### Print the list to confirm success
print(list)
browser.quit()
